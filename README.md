# data-preprocessing-template

My personal template for data preprocessing operations, written in Python 3

In this simple template, I created my own template for later usage on data preprocessing. I titled preprocessing steps with python comments
betwen three stars such as : *** Example title ***

In the other hand, near some methods and under some titles, there are explanations for educational purposes and these explanations are in Turkish language.

Just so you know, some variable names which I used in this template, may also be written in Turkish language.

In conclusion, you are free to take this template and personalise for yourself.
